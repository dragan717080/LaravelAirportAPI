# <a name="no-link"></a>Laravel Starter Kit

Custom starter kit code for Laravel to be used in different projects. Database agnostic but I've used PostgreSQL.

## <a name="no-link"></a>Technologies Used

- **Laravel**

Laravel is a PHP web application framework known for its elegant syntax and developer-friendly features. It follows the MVC pattern and provides powerful tools for building robust web applications.

- **PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL is a RDBMS known for its reliability, robust feature set, and extensibility. It is highly regarded for its ability to handle complex queries, manage high concurrency, and provide advanced data types and indexing capabilities. 

## Service Repository Pattern

This project uses the Service Repository pattern to organize our code and database interactions. This pattern separates the logic for handling business operations (services) from the details of accessing the data (repositories). Here are some advantages of using this pattern:

1. **Separation of Concerns:** The pattern separates the database access logic from the business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

2. **Testability:** By isolating database access in repositories and business logic in services, it becomes easier to write unit tests for each component.

3. **Flexibility:** The pattern allows us to easily swap out the underlying data storage mechanism without affecting the business logic, providing flexibility and future-proofing our application.

4. **Code Reusability:** Services and repositories can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing code duplication.

5. **Scalability:** The pattern helps in scaling the application by providing a structured way to manage data access and business logic.
